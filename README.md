# Chess

It's chess, in the terminal!

## Inspiration

I wanted to build an application in C++ using bazel. It's been a while since I've coded my own project end-to-end. I've learned some thing in my day job, but frankly, I want to sharpen up my skills.

There's probably a lot of stuff I can improve. It might be nice to do a writeup at the end of this that describes the things that I did well (not a lot) and the things that I did poorly (a lot).
